in order to run the project locally you need to:
clone -> npm install -> npm run serve

run build for production
run lint for linting //optional :)

## Overview

I've used SCSS for styling, you'll find one global stylesheet that's included to hold all of the variables for easier use in each component.

If I were to re-do this project I would probably structure the components a bit differently, however there's no turning back at this point.

I've included the icons in a separate component, which may not be the most nessesary or practical thing to do.

in terms of the javascript logic I have one thing to note, I probably should have made the search trigger only after a submit, instead of constantly running while the user is typing, probably not very efficient.

## I'd say I did pretty well, but I'd like to hear what you think.

## Thank you for the opportunity and I'm looking forwards to your feedback.

## Best, George
